    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza dough that can be baked with any topping of your choosing.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>1 package active dry yeast</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</p>
        <p>3/4 cup warm water</p>
        <p>2 cups bread flour</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Gather all Ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Stir yeast, sugar, and warm water together in a small bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Stir 2 cups of bread flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of olive oil; beat with dough hook on medium speed until dough is soft and slightly tacky, about 8 minutes, adding up to 3 tablespoons more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours. (Alternatively, cover and let rise in the refrigerator overnight.)</p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) with oven rack positioned in lower third. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a round and roll into a thin crust. Place on a large parchment-lined baking sheet or pizza pan.</p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Top with desired pizza sauce and toppings. Brush edges with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.</p>

        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden and cheese is melted bubbly, about 12 to 15 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>Serve and enjoy.</p>
