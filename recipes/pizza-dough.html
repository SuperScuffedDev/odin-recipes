    <p>Pizza dough that can be baked with any topping of your choosing.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>1 package active dry yeast</p></li>
        <li><p>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>3/4 cup warm water</p></li>
        <li><p>2 cups bread flour</p></li>
        <li><p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p></li>
        <li><p>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Gather all Ingredients.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir yeast, sugar, and warm water together in a small bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir 2 cups of bread flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of olive oil; beat with dough hook on medium speed until dough is soft and slightly tacky, about 8 minutes, adding up to 3 tablespoons more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours. (Alternatively, cover and let rise in the refrigerator overnight.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) with oven rack positioned in lower third. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a round and roll into a thin crust. Place on a large parchment-lined baking sheet or pizza pan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Top with desired pizza sauce and toppings. Brush edges with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden and cheese is melted bubbly, about 12 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <li><p>Serve and enjoy.</p></li>
